# Use case
There are a group of close friends in office and they daily leave for a tea break in evening. They want to play a game on who buys the tea for a group. They usually use paper chits to pick one chit among other, the guy who's name in the chit he has to pay the bill for the day.

I thought this could be a interesting App to develop and help other people on the funny use cases. This App can be used for anywhere that you want to go randomly. It allows to customize the group as per your needs.

And the data you feed into this App, will be stored and you can use it same on your next visit.
